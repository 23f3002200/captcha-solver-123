# Simple CAPTCHA Solver Web ApplicationThis is a simple, single-file web application designed to present a CAPTCHA challenge and allow users to submit their solution. It's built with responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS.## Features- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.- **Dynamic Image Loading:** Displays a CAPTCHA image either from a URL parameter or a default local file.- **User Input:** Provides an input field for users to enter their CAPTCHA solution.- **Verification:** Compares user input against a hardcoded solution for the default image (for demonstration purposes).## Usage### Local SetupTo run this application locally, simply save the `index.html` file and the `sample.png` image in the same directory. Open `index.html` in your web browser.### Custom CAPTCHA ImageYou can specify a custom image URL by appending a `url` query parameter to the `index.html` URL.Example:```http://localhost:8000/index.html?url=https://example.com/some-captcha-image.png```If no `url` parameter is provided, the application will default to displaying `sample.png`.### Solving the CAPTCHAFor the default `sample.png` image, the correct solution is `ADURS`. Enter this into the input field and click 'Verify'.## Technology Stack- **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and responsive design.- **JavaScript:** For handling image loading, user input, and CAPTCHA verification logic.## DevelopmentThis project is a self-contained HTML file and requires no build steps or external dependencies beyond a web browser and internet access for the Tailwind CSS CDN.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
